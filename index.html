        <p>'I created an ecommerce website for a family-owned Italian bakery using the Shopify platform. This project showcases my coding proficiency, as well as my in-depth knowledge of Shopify\'s admin and its third-party app ecosystem. I utilized my data-analyst background to reach insights that led to improved UX, navigation, and product categorization. I communicated with a marketing team to obtain assets required for the website and various ad campaigns, and worked with a fulfillment team to understand business needs surrounding checkout and delivery.'

        <p>'I modified Shopify\'s leading free theme, Dawn, in order to provide merchants who sell cakes with additional functionality. Features of Cake Dawn include: infinite scroll, product order minimums, custom product text-input fields, and custom popup modals. Implementing these features required knowledge of Liquid, as well as an understanding of Shopify\'s schemas, metafields, standard objects, and theme structure.'

        <p>'For this project, I analysed Bike Share Toronto data to find that riders tended to lose elevation (i.e. bike downhill more often than uphill) in 2022. This project required me to collect data from three different sources: ride data (CSV), station data (JSON), and elevation data (DEM/TIF). Seaborn was used to create visualizations.'
