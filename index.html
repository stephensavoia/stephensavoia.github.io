        text:'I used the Shopify platform to create an ecommerce website for a family-owned Italian bakery. I communicated with a marketing team to obtain assets required for the website and ad campaigns. I worked with a fulfillment team to understand business needs surrounding checkout and delivery. I used various analysis tools to reach data-driven insights that led to improved UX, navigation, and product categorization.'

        text:'I modified Shopify\'s leading free theme, Dawn, in order to provide merchants with additional functionality, including: infinite scroll, product order minimums, and custom product text-input fields.

This project required me to collect data from three different sources: ride data (CSV), station data (JSON), and elevation data (DEM/TIF). Seaborn was used to create visualizations.'
