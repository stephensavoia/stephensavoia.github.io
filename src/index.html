        Cycle TO Fun is a project I developed using Remix, Cloudflare D1, and
        DaisyUI/Tailwind. It's a website that allows users to view a collection
        of Toronto cycling routes via a sleek and user-friendly interface.
        GitHub is utilized for version control and automatic deployment to
        Cloudflare.

        This is a game that I creating using Remixâ€”a React framework owned by
        Shopify. Utilizing live weather data sourced from Open-Meteo, the
        gameplay blends geography trivia with an element of chance. The project
        is hosted on Cloudflare pages and is updated automatically via its
        Github repository.

        I created coded a custom Shopify theme section to allow customers to add
        a random product to their cart. In completing this project, I
        demonstrated my ability to utilize of many common web technologies, as
        well as my understanding of the standard Shopify objects. I followed
        best practices for theme customization by isolating new code and
        utilizing existing theme functionality where possible.

      <p>
        I modified Shopify's leading free theme, Dawn, in order to provide
        merchants who sell cakes with additional functionality. Features of Cake
        Dawn include: infinite scroll, product order minimums, custom product
        text-input fields, and custom popup modals. Implementing these features
        required knowledge of Liquid, as well as an understanding of Shopify's
        schemas, metafields, standard objects, and theme structure.

        I created an ecommerce website for a family-owned Italian bakery using
        the Shopify platform. This project showcases my coding proficiency, as
        well as my in-depth knowledge of Shopify's admin and its third-party app
        ecosystem. I utilized my data-analyst background to reach insights that
        led to improved UX, navigation, and product categorization. I
        communicated with a marketing team to obtain assets required for the
        website and various ad campaigns, and worked with a fulfillment team to
        understand business needs surrounding checkout and delivery.

      <p>
        For this project, I analyzed Bike Share Toronto data to find that riders
        tended to lose elevation (i.e. bike downhill more often than uphill) in
        2022. This project required me to collect data from three different
        sources: ride data (CSV), station data (JSON), and elevation data
        (DEM/TIF). Seaborn was used to create visualizations.

        This is a project I started after completing the Coursera Google Data

        R for data aggregation and visualization, I chose to explore a rather
        obvious hypothesis: more people will visit U.S. national parks when the
        weather is warm.
